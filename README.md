### `[FORKED CHROMIUM · TILING HUD · CYBERPUNK]`

> *"Not Chrome with a skin — a real Blink engine turned into a keyboard-driven, tiling, cyberpunk workspace."*

zwire is a **Chromium/Blink browser forked into a cyberpunk HUD**. It is not a
theme and not a wrapper — it is a real engine running a full keyboard-driven
workspace layered on top:

- a **tmux-style tiling overlay** — unlimited windows, recursive pane splits,
  each pane an embedded webview of any site;
- a **⌘K command palette**, **vim-style navigation**, and a **find bar**;
- durable, named **session management** with full CRUD + SVG layout previews;
- **HUD reimplementations of Chrome's own internal pages** (extensions,
  settings, history, bookmarks, version) plus a keyboard-remap page and a
  **dashboard** — one searchable, drag-orderable tile grid that launches every
  HUD page *and* every `chrome://` internal page;
- **8 color schemes** — each with a **light variant** — that drive the browser
  chrome natively, with a light/dark toggle that syncs across the HUD, new-tab
  page, and `zpwrchrome` instantly;
- a **browser-wide audio engine** — an always-on zdsp-core chain (parametric EQ +
  channel strip + saturation/dynamics + modulation + time FX + spatial + limiter)
  compiled into the audio service (every tab, live-reconfigurable
  with nothing open) plus a live **Audio HUD page** with real post-DSP spectrum
  and meters;
- **lifecycle hooks** — a **Hooks HUD page** that binds
  [stryke](https://github.com/MenkeTechnologies/strykelang) scripts to ~50
  browser events (tab / window / navigation / download / bookmark / terminal /
  scheme / audio / ⌘K-command lifecycle, plus an `action` catch-all), with a
  searchable event picker;
- an **automation verb bus** — one namespaced `browser.*` surface (tab / group /
  window ops, edge-snapping, downloads, browsing-data clearing, bookmarks,
  reading list, extensions, power, screenshot, notify, tmux toggle) that the ⌘K
  palette, keyboard shortcuts, and stryke hooks all drive through a single
  service-worker executor, published as a typed, introspectable manifest;
- the **`zpwrchrome`** power-tool preloaded against a dedicated profile, so it
  never touches your system Chrome.

The HUD layer (`extensions/hud-internal`) is ~7,400 lines of extension code
across 11 subsystems and 15 pages, assembled on the **`zgui-core`** shared GUI
toolkit (253 `ZGui.*` components, a git submodule loaded straight from
`lib/zgui-core/webui/`) and bridged to the **`zwire-host`** native agent (a
single Rust binary, its own submodule). Under it, a **24-patch C++ fork**
restyles the *native* chrome the extension layer can't reach.

**zwire is the full fork.** The 24-patch series (`fork/`) compiles a patched
Chromium so the *native* chrome carries the HUD too — sharp tab shapes, the
Share Tech Mono UI font, the neon toolbar, the omnibox, the 8 HUD schemes wired
into the color mixer + DevTools, native Views menus/dialogs bound to the HUD
palette, and a browser-wide audio EQ + live meters — the styling and behavior an
extension can't reach. See [`fork/README.md`](fork/README.md).

## `[0x00] WHY A REAL BLINK BASE`

`zpwrchrome` is a Manifest V3 extension that needs `userScripts`,
`declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess`, `nativeMessaging`, `webRequest`, and a
service-worker background (`minimum_chrome_version: 127`). None of that runs on
WebKit (Tauri/Safari) or Servo — **only a real Chromium engine loads it.** The
tiling overlay also iframes arbitrary sites into its panes, which needs the
fork's frame-ancestors bypass (patch 0008) — impossible in a wrapper.

The fork compiles unbranded (`is_chrome_branded=false`), so it carries **no
Google logo and no "for automated testing" banner** (that stripe is exclusive to
Chrome for Testing), and it retains the `--load-extension` switch that preloads
`zpwrchrome` — [removed from *branded* Chrome in version 137][psa]. Stock Google
Chrome can no longer be scripted this way; a Chromium build can.

## `[0x01] THE HUD WORKSPACE`

`extensions/hud-internal` is where zwire stops being "a browser" and becomes a
workspace. It is a content-script + page bundle (~7,400 LOC), not a theme.

**`ztmux` — the tiling overlay.** A tmux server, in the browser. The tiling
window-manager itself is `ZGui.tmux` from the shared `zgui-core` toolkit; zwire
drives it with two thin adapters — `ztmux-config.js` (top frame: mounts each
pane as an address-bar + framed webview, feeds the WM) and `ztmux-pane.js` (the
`all_frames` pane-side forwarder that relays the prefix, synced keystrokes, and
copy-mode yanks up to the top frame). Recursive binary pane splits, unlimited
windows, and **every pane is a live webview** (any URL, iframed via the
allow-framing patch). Driven by a
**rebindable prefix** (default `Ctrl-b` / `⌥B`; set your own — `C-a` — on the
Keyboard page, with a configurable timeout). 45 prefix actions, all remappable:

- **panes** — split h/v, directional nav (arrows + `h/j/k/l`), resize
  (`H/J/K/L`), zoom, close, swap, rotate, break-to-window, pane numbers;
- **layouts** — cycle even/main/tiled, plus preset grids (4 / 8 / 16 panes);
- **windows** — new, next/prev/last, rename, move, go-to, list, kill;
- **partial synchronize-panes** — broadcast typing to a *chosen subset* of
  panes, not just all-or-nothing (`Ctrl-b e` toggles all, `Ctrl-b E` toggles one);
- **copy mode** — scroll + yank selection into a paste-buffer stack;
- **marks**, **clock**, and a registry-driven **help** overlay.

**Sessions (`pages/sessions.html`).** Durable, named tmux sessions — windows,
panes, and each pane's webview — saved to `chrome.storage` (survives restart).
A full CRUD page: create / rename / duplicate / delete / load / import-export,
per-pane URL editing, and a **live SVG preview** of each window's tiling. Save
the current layout with `Ctrl-b S`, attach a saved one with `Ctrl-b s`.

**Hooks (`pages/hooks.html`).** Bind
[stryke](https://github.com/MenkeTechnologies/strykelang) scripts to browser
lifecycle events. The service worker fires ~50 events — tab
open/close/activate/update/move, window open/close/focus, navigation, downloads,
bookmarks, history, the HUD terminal, scheme changes, the audio engine, ⌘K
palette commands, plus an `action` catch-all for every command — and `zwire-host`
runs each **enabled** hook whose event matches, feeding it the event JSON on
stdin. The script prints an `{actions:[…]}` object the host dispatches (`notify` /
`open` / `exec` / `pub`). The page has a searchable event picker, a Monaco editor
with the stryke LSP (vim/emacs modes), and a Test-run button.

**Automation verb bus (`background.js` → `execZbCmd`).** Every HUD surface —
the ⌘K palette, content-script shortcuts, and stryke hooks — drives the browser
through one namespaced verb bus. A custom-command store seeds the defaults on
first run; each invocation routes through the `zb_cmd` storage bus to a single
executor in the service worker. The surface spans **tab ops** (open / close
left/right/others/duplicates / reopen / duplicate / pin / mute / discard / move /
sort / group), **tab-group** collapse/expand, **window ops** (new / close /
merge / min-max-restore / fullscreen / center / next-display), **edge snapping**
(left / right / top / bottom + four corners), **navigation** (back / forward /
home / zoom), **downloads** (pause / resume / cancel / retry / clear / reveal),
**browsing-data** clearing (cache / cookies / history / passwords / all),
**history + bookmark + reading-list** edits, **extension** enable/disable/
uninstall + **app launch**, **keep-awake** power control, **screenshot**,
**notify**, and the **`tmux`** overlay toggle. The typed manifest is published
through `ZGui.automation` — the shared registry every embedded core contributes
verbs to — so a stryke script sees one combined, introspectable `browser.*`
surface via `App::here()->verbs()`.

**Around it:** a **⌘K command palette** (`zpalette`) — which also carries the
scheme picker, the light/dark toggle, the settings controls, a **window/tab
exposé** (`zexpose` — a tile grid with one tile per tab showing a live text
excerpt of the page's content; click to focus that tab, Esc to close; ports
zterm's ztmux pane exposé via `ZGui.expose`), **Page Actions** (`zpageactions` —
Vivaldi-style live CSS-filter transforms on the current page: grayscale, sepia,
invert, high-contrast, blur, hue-rotate…, remembered per site), and an **inline
compute layer** (ported from zgo-core): type a sum (`2^10`, `sqrt(2)+1`), a unit
conversion (`10 km to miles`, `72 f in c`, `1 gb to mb`), a live currency
conversion (`100 usd to eur`, rates fetched + cached by the host), a percentage
(`20% of 150`, `150 + 20%`, `10 to 12`), or an `@`-prefixed stryke expression
(`@ 1:10 |> sum`) and the answer pins to the top row, copyable with ⏎ —
**vim-style
motions** (`zkeys`/`zvim` — jump / scroll / tabs / launch categories), a **find
bar** (`zfind`), a **powerline status bar** (`ZGui.powerline`, fed by
`zpowerline.js` from the native host's `zb_sys` system stats + the tmux
window/pane segment), and **HUD reimplementations**
of `chrome://{extensions,settings,history,bookmarks,downloads,version}` — the
**History** page defaults to a full-height, all-time list (Cmd+Y) and adds a
Vivaldi-style calendar dashboard (Month/Week/Day: a month calendar with per-day
activity, a per-day Entries list, and an analytics rail — a Browsing Activity area
chart, a Link Transition donut, and Top Domains) — plus a **Notes** manager
(Markdown notes in folders, ported from Vivaldi), a **Translate** panel
(30+ languages, auto-detect, ported from Vivaldi),
Keyboard, Commands, Sessions, a **Hooks** page, CI, a **Host** console, a
**Terminal**, and an **App Store**, plus a live **Audio** page. Notes and Translate
open from the **Dashboard** tile grid (kept off the crowded page nav bar). Every
shortcut, and the tmux prefix itself, is remappable on the Keyboard page.

**Host console (`pages/host.html`).** A HUD tab that talks to the `zwire-host`
native-messaging host directly — inspect and drive the native bridge from inside
the browser.

**App Store (`pages/store.html`).** A HUD storefront tab for the
**MenkeTechnologies app store** — the paid Rust desktop apps and audio plugins,
each a `ZGui.productCard` linking to its live product page to buy. zwire is free
and open source; this is its shop window. On **first run** (`onInstalled`),
`background.js` opens this page once with a welcome modal, so the store is shown
up front — the new-tab page stays untouched.

**Audio (`pages/audio.html`).** A live audio dashboard over a browser-wide DSP
engine the fork compiles into the audio service (patches 0022–0024): an always-on
**zdsp-core** chain applied to **every** output stream (media element, MSE/YouTube,
Web Audio, WebRTC) before the OS device, live-reconfigurable with nothing open and
no relaunch. The chain, in order:

- **EQ** — preamp + RBJ-biquad cascade; band types `lowshelf` · `peaking` ·
  `highshelf` · `lowpass` · `highpass` · `bandpass` · `notch` · `allpass`.
- **Channel strip** — gain · drive (tanh soft-clip) · equal-power pan · mono-fold.
- **Saturation / dynamics** — waveshaper (arctan/foldback/hard-clip) · harmonic
  exciter · bit-crusher + decimator · noise gate · stereo-linked feed-forward
  compressor · auto-wah (envelope-swept resonant band-pass).
- **Modulation** — chorus · flanger (with feedback) · phaser (LFO-swept all-pass
  cascade) · ring modulator · tremolo (LFO amplitude), each with rate/depth.
- **Time** — stereo feedback delay/echo · reduced-Freeverb reverb.
- **Spatial** — Haas widener · headphone cross-feed · auto-pan (LFO stereo) ·
  M/S stereo width.
- **Limiter** — brickwall peak limiter, dead-last so nothing re-clips.

Every block is unity/bypass by default and per-stream (own buffers), so the engine
stays bit-identical passthrough until a control is engaged. The page renders the
**real post-DSP output** — Goertzel spectrum bars, peak/RMS meters, phase
correlation, and a stereo scope — pumped back over the native host (no
`tabCapture`, so watching the meters never touches the audio). DSP correctness is
pinned by `fork/tests/run_dsp_tests.sh`, which extracts the engine straight from
patch 0022 and asserts per-effect invariants.

**`zgui-core` — the shared GUI toolkit (`lib/zgui-core`, submodule).** The HUD is
not hand-rolled per page; it is assembled from **`ZGui`**, a cyberpunk web-component
library (253 modules under `webui/`) shared across the MenkeTechnologies app
suite and loaded **directly from the submodule path** (never copied — copies go
stale). The tiling WM (`ZGui.tmux`), the ⌘K palette (`ZGui.palette`), fuzzy find
(`ZGui.fzf`), the scheme engine (`ZGui.colorscheme`), the powerline
(`ZGui.powerline`), the store's product cards (`ZGui.productCard`), and the whole
Audio meter chain (`ZGui.spectrumAnalyzer`, `goniometer`, `correlationMeter`,
`peakMeter`, `lufsMeter`, `eq`, `dbFader`) are all `ZGui` components; the
`extensions/hud-internal` code is the zwire-specific glue that wires them to
Chrome APIs and the native host.

**`zwire-host` — the native agent (`native/zwire-host`, submodule).** A single
self-contained Rust binary that the HUD talks to over Chrome native messaging. It
exposes the local machine — sysmon (the `zb_sys` stats the powerline renders),
filesystem, `exec`, PTY, a key-value store, hooks/jobs/watch, and OS ops — and
also runs as a Unix-socket NDJSON daemon. It backs the **Host** console page,
feeds the status bar, and is the filesystem bridge for the audio engine (the page
writes the EQ spec and reads the meter frames over its persistent port; the
sandboxed audio service can't touch those files itself — see patches 0022–0024).

## `[0x02] ARCHITECTURE`

| Layer | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Base** | The compiled `fork/` build — a patched Chromium (pinned tag `150.0.7871.46`), unbranded release |
| **HUD workspace** | `extensions/hud-internal` — the tiling overlay (`ztmux-config`/`ztmux-pane` driving `ZGui.tmux`), ⌘K palette (`zpalette`), vim nav + keymap (`zkeys`/`zvim`), find (`zfind`), status bar (`zpowerline` → `ZGui.powerline`), the 8-scheme picker (with light/dark toggle), and 15 HUD pages (incl. the Sessions manager, Keyboard remapper, Host console, App Store + a live Audio page). MV3 content scripts on `chrome://*/*` + `http(s)`; bridges to a native host. Needs `--extensions-on-chrome-urls` |
| **GUI toolkit** | `extensions/hud-internal/lib/zgui-core` — the shared `ZGui` component library (253 `webui/*` modules), a submodule loaded straight from path (never copied). Every HUD page composes `ZGui` components; zwire supplies only the glue |
| **Native host** | `extensions/hud-internal/native/zwire-host` — a single Rust binary (native-messaging host + Unix-socket daemon: sysmon, fs, exec, PTY, KV, hooks, OS ops), a submodule. Backs the Host console + powerline stats + the audio EQ/meters file bridge |
| **New tab** | `newtab/` — a `chrome_url_overrides.newtab` extension (in-repo, not a submodule): the full HUD new-tab (Orbitron, CRT scanlines, neon omnibox), fonts vendored locally |
| **Power-tool** | `extensions/zpwrchrome` — the MV3 power-tool, loaded as a submodule (reuse, not copy) |
| **Theme** | `theme/` — a colors-only Chrome theme. Present but **not** launcher-loaded — the fork's native color mixer (patch 0002) and the HUD skin own the palette, and a static theme applies last and would override them |
| **Launcher** | `bin/zwire` — starts the base against `$ZWIRE_STATE/profile` with `newtab` + `zpwrchrome` + `hud-internal` loaded and `--extensions-on-chrome-urls` set (any dir missing a `manifest.json` is skipped, so a missing submodule degrades gracefully) |
| **Fork** | `fork/` — the 24-patch source build that restyles the native chrome (tab shapes, fonts, borders, omnibox, DevTools schemes, native menus/dialogs) and tunes native behavior (forced zwire new-tab, session restore, framing, browser-wide audio EQ + meters) the extension layer can't reach; this is what zwire ships as |

A Chrome theme extension changes **colors only** — it cannot reshape tabs, fonts,
or toolbar (those are native C++), and it cannot add a tiling overlay or a
command palette. The HUD extension layer adds the workspace; the `fork/` build
adds the native styling — together they are zwire.

## `[0x03] INSTALL`

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/MenkeTechnologies/zwire.git
cd zwire
scripts/install.sh          # fetch base + link `zwire` on PATH + rebrand (macOS)
zwire                    # launch
```

`install.sh` downloads the Chromium base into `$ZWIRE_STATE/base`, symlinks
`bin/zwire` into `~/.local/bin`, and on macOS rebrands the base bundle's Dock
name and icon in place. Re-run after a base upgrade.

`--recurse-submodules` pulls the three submodules zwire depends on:
`extensions/zpwrchrome` (the MV3 power-tool), `extensions/hud-internal/lib/zgui-core`
(the shared `ZGui` toolkit the HUD pages are built from), and
`extensions/hud-internal/native/zwire-host` (the Rust native host). The launcher
skips any extension dir missing a `manifest.json`, so a not-yet-fetched submodule
degrades gracefully rather than failing the launch.

## `[0x04] USAGE`

```sh
zwire                         # open with the HUD new tab
zwire https://github.com      # open a url
zwire --incognito             # any Chromium flag is passed through
```

Once running, press the tmux prefix (default `Ctrl-b` or `⌥B`) to arm the tiling
overlay, then a pane/window action; `⌘K` opens the command palette. Rebind the
prefix and every shortcut on the Keyboard HUD page.

State lives under `$ZWIRE_STATE`, which defaults to the OS application-data
directory — macOS `~/Library/Application Support/com.menketechnologies.zwire`
(the bundle id), Linux `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/zwire`, Windows
`%APPDATA%\zwire`. A one-time launch auto-migrates a legacy `~/.zwire` (and, on
macOS, an earlier bare `~/Library/Application Support/zwire`) into the new
location:

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `base/` | the Chromium binary |
| `base.path` / `base.version` | resolved binary + pinned revision |
| `profile/` | the dedicated user-data-dir (bookmarks, history, sessions) |
| `ext/` | per-user copy of the loaded extensions, staged from the `.app` bundle at launch (each user needs a writable copy — Chromium writes extension `_metadata/` indexes there) |

Override the base with `ZWIRE_BASE=/path/to/chromium zwire`.

## `[0x05] FULL-HUD FORK`

The extension layer can't restyle the native chrome (tab shapes, fonts, toolbar
are C++), so zwire ships as the fork: `fork/` compiles a patched Chromium
(~100 GB checkout, 1–4 hr first build, ongoing rebase maintenance):

```sh
fork/fetch.sh                                   # depot_tools + pinned Chromium
fork/apply-patches.sh  ~/zwire-chromium/src  # HUD patch series
fork/build.sh          ~/zwire-chromium/src  # the long compile
fork/package.sh        ~/zwire-chromium/src/out/zwire
```

All **24** HUD patches are **authored** against the pinned tag (`150.0.7871.46`)
and verified apply-clean. The nine styling/behavior patches: hard trapezoid tabs
(`tab_style_views.cc`), the cyberpunk palette + the 8 HUD schemes on
frame/toolbar/tabs/omnibox (`chrome_color_mixer.cc`), the Share Tech Mono /
Monaco UI font (`resource_bundle.cc`), a neon cyan under-toolbar line
(`toolbar_view.cc`), a sharp omnibox field (`location_bar_view.cc`), `zwire`
product strings (`BRANDING`), the 8 HUD schemes in the DevTools Theme dropdown
(`design_system_tokens.css` + `main-meta.ts` + `ThemeSupport.ts`), allow-framing
any site so the `ztmux` overlay can iframe pages (`ancestor_throttle.cc`), and
extension-command focus hand-off so the ⌘K palette is typeable from the omnibox
(`extension_keybinding_registry_views.cc`). Six patches force zwire's behavior
over Chromium's defaults: `chrome://newtab` always resolves to the zwire new-tab
(`search.cc`), pinned extension actions never drop to the overflow puzzle
(`toolbar_view.cc`), a host page's `frame-src`/`child-src` CSP never blocks a
sub-frame nav so panes can embed any site (`navigation_request.cc`), startup
restores the last session (`session_startup_pref.cc`), no "Restore pages?" crash
bubble (`session_crashed_bubble_view.cc`), and no navigation block for a
not-yet-registered extension so the new-tab override always loads
(`extension_navigation_throttle.cc`). Two more bind the *native* Views surface to
the HUD palette so app/context menus, dialogs, dropdowns, and textfields track
the scheme + light/dark toggle instead of the OS default
(`chrome_color_mixer.cc`, the menu family then every core primitive). Three keep
the HUD's own extension pages and the Chrome Web Store working: allowlist
`hud-internal` for `developerPrivate` + `settingsPrivate` so the Extensions /
Settings pages have their APIs (`_permission_features.json`), a crash fix so a
content script can call `chrome.*` mid-navigation on the store without tripping a
`NOTREACHED` (`extension_function_dispatcher.cc`), and dropping the gallery
script-block so content scripts + `executeScript` run on the Web Store domains
(`chrome_extensions_client.cc`). One forces immediate ⌘Q (no hold-to-quit)
(`app_controller_mac.mm`). The last three are the **audio engine**: an always-on
zdsp-core chain (EQ + channel strip + saturation/dynamics + modulation + time FX +
spatial + limiter) compiled into the audio service so
*every* stream is processed before the OS device (`output_controller.cc` +
`chrome_content_browser_client.cc`), tab-capture with no picker so the Audio page
can analyze a playing tab (`tab_capture_api.cc`), and live EQ reconfiguration +
an output-meters back-channel to the Audio page
(`audio_service.mojom` + `service.cc` + `audio_service.cc`). Apply-clean proves
the diff context matches; `fork/build.sh` is the compile gate. See
[`fork/README.md`](fork/README.md) and [`fork/patches/README.md`](fork/patches/README.md).

**Building it:** the fork is a normal Chromium checkout + `autoninja`, so any box
that can build Chromium can build zwire — no paid infra required. It does **not**
fit on stock GitHub-hosted runners (the ~100 GB checkout exceeds their disk and a
cold build races the 6 h job cap); build it locally, or point a self-hosted
runner at a warm checkout so only the delta rebuilds.

## `[0x06] UPDATING THE BASE`

```sh
scripts/fetch-base.sh              # latest Chromium snapshot
scripts/fetch-base.sh 1656770      # pin an exact revision
scripts/rebrand-macos.sh           # re-apply the rebrand after the swap
```

## `[0x07] NOTES`

- **Native messaging:** `zpwrchrome`'s `pass` and segmented-download features
  need its native host installed — see the
  [zpwrchrome](https://github.com/MenkeTechnologies/zpwrchrome) setup.
- **Developer-mode banner:** unpacked extensions loaded via `--load-extension`
  show Chromium's developer-extensions notice. It is cosmetic; the extensions
  run fully.
- **Cross-platform:** the `zwire` launcher works on macOS (aarch64/x64) and
  Linux (x86_64). The in-place Dock rebrand is macOS-only; on Linux the launcher
  name is the brand.
